# Summary

This repo is maintained for operational aspects of the [Reignite Performance service](https://reigniteperformance.com).

## Licensing

In order to determine whether a given code base meets the coding lines licensing requirement for a given price tier we utilize a [powershell script to calculate the total lines within a code base](./Licensing/linecount.ps1). You may use this prior to or after order subscribing to calculate the total lines of code in your own code base to ensure licensing limitations are met.

Currently, this script is targeting the two languages this service supports:

- C#
- VB.NET
